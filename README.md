# arr_vs_ll

After watching a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQs6IC-vgmo&ab_channel=AlessandroStamatto) by Bjarne Stroustrup 
and later a [recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jiP4pOoG8g&t=3528s&ab_channel=TheVimeagen) of the benchmark in TypeScript by the Primeagen
I wanted to redo the benchmark myself in C. 

This repo is just a quick and dirty recreation of the comparison, and its results roughly line up with what was expected given the results of the other two videos.
